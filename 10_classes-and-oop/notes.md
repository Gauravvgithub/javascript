## why use OOP

## parts of OOP

Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars

- Abstraction - use case (hide details {all internal details} / example - (fetch))

- Encapsulation - use case (wrapper or restricts direct access to certain properties and methods of an object.)

- Inheritance - use case (Inheritance is a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (or object) to inherit properties and methods from another. This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication.)

- Polymorphism - use case (A single function or method behaves differently based on the object calling it.) (
    - Types of Polymorphism in JavaScript
- Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
- Method Overloading (Not natively supported, but can be achieved)
)
